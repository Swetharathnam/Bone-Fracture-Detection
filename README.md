# Bone-Fracture-Detection
The image processing technique is extremely helpful for several applications like biomedical, security, satellite imaging, personal image, medicine, etc. 
The research design involves data collection, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification and evaluation of the proposed method. The sample dataset were x-ray images collected
In this we are using CNN (Convolution neural networks) to find the fracture. The proposed method can find suitable use in categorization of fracture types on different bone images based on the results obtained from the experiment.
